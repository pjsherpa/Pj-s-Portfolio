  <h2 class="side" id="Pj">About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I'am a hands-on, highly motivated individual and currently part of an amazing Coding Bootcamp at UC Berkeley. I'am working towards being a Web Developer as my course involves me with HTML,CSS and Java-Script. I'm currently experienced with HTML, advanced level of CSS and github.
      In my past experience as an Accountant I had a huge role communicating with management,clients,vendors and external auditors. My last work as an Accountant at Sony Music Australia, I had a role where I was teaching my colleagues on a new cloud based system designed specifically for the company. Which introduced me and lead me towards my interest on web development and how it works.
      I'm adventurous and love to travel.
      My qualification includes my Bachelor of business in Accounting from the Univesity of Technology Sydney,Australia.
      I can be reached for an interview at your convenience. Thank you in advance for your time. I look forward from hearing back from your company.
